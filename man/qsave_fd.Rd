\usage{
qsave_fd(x, fd, 
preset = "high", algorithm = "zstd", compress_level = 4L, 
shuffle_control = 15L, check_hash=TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object to serialize.}

\item{fd}{A file descriptor}

\item{preset}{One of "fast", "balanced" , "high" (default), "archive", "uncompressed" or "custom". See details.}

\item{algorithm}{Compression algorithm used: "lz4", "zstd", "lz4hc", "zstd_stream" or "uncompressed".}

\item{compress_level}{The compression level used (Default 4). For lz4, this number must be > 1 (higher is less compressed). For zstd, a number between -50 to 22 (higher is more compressed).}

\item{shuffle_control}{An integer setting the use of byte shuffle compression. A value between 0 and 15 (Default 15). See details.}

\item{check_hash}{Default TRUE, compute a hash which can be used to verify file integrity during serialization}
}
\value{
the number of bytes serialized (returned invisibly)
}
\description{
Saves an object to a file descriptor
}
\details{
This function serializes and compresses an R object to a stream using a file descriptor
If your data is important, make sure you know what happens on the other side of the pipe. See examples for usage.
